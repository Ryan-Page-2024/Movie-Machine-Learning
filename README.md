# Sneak a Peek Behind the Scenes: Movies & Machine Learning
I built machine learning models and trained them on a collection of movies to assess how likely I am to re-watch some of my favorite films.

Utilizing pairwise comparison and feature engineering, I created preference data and features encompassing themes such as: Genre, Runtime, Budget, Release Year, and More!

I trained algorithms using this data, including Random Forests and XGBoost to enhance the accuracy of predictions. I then applied the best model to additional movies to generate new predictions and assess their re-watch potential.

My primary goal was to develop a model that identifies movies that align with my preferences.
