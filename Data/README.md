## File Name: Movies List
The original dataset consists of 50 movies and is used to initialize the data and define the 'Movies' variable referenced in the `compare_movies` function. Initially, each movie is assigned a default ***Re-Watch Desire*** score of 5, along with 0 ***Wins***, 0 ***Losses***, and 0 ***Ties***. <br><br> In the `compare_movies` function, users are prompted to input their movie preferences, which updates the respective movies ***Re-Watch Desire***, ***Wins***, ***Losses***, and ***Ties***, with results clipped between 0 and 10. <br><br> The results are captured in the Movie Comparisons and Comparison Results files.

## File Name: Movie Comparisons
This file stores the scoring for each movie comparison, tracking updates to ***Re-Watch Desire***, ***Wins***, ***Losses***, and ***Ties***. <br><br> Based on user input, a movie's ***Re-Watch Desire*** increases by 0.1 for a win and decreases by 0.1 for a loss, with scores clipped between 0 and 10. Ties do not affect the ***Re-Watch Desire*** but are recorded. I included the option to treat a movie as a tie, though I chose not to.

## File Name: Comparison Results

## File Name: Merged Data
The Merged Data file combines Movie Comparisons and Movie Details, and is used to train and test the Random Forest and XGBoost models. <br><br> The target variable for these models is Re-Watch Desire, while the columns from Movie Details (excluding the categorical Genre variable) serve as the initial features. <br><br> After reviewing feature correlations, the Genre Flags ***'Adventure'***, ***'Animation'***, and ***'Family'*** were removed to optimize the model.

<br><br>

## File Name: New Movies
The New Movies file introduces a set of unseen movies - including DiDi, Forrest Gump, American Psycho, Iron Man, and American Beauty - to evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model. <br><br> The Random Forest model was selected for this, as it is the better model for generalization on unseen data <br>(evaluated in the script using MAE and RMSE). <br><br> These movies are used to test how well the model generalizes on data it hasn't encountered before, helping assess the accuracy and robustness of predictions on ***Re-Watch Desire*** for new films.
