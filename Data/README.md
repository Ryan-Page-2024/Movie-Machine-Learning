## File Name: Movies List
This is the original dataset that contains 50 movies. It is used to initialize the Data and define the Movies variable referenced in the compare_movies function. From this dataset the first ten movies were evaluated using pairwise comparison at first and subsequently this pairwise comparison was done in batches of five because of the time intensity it would otherwise take in one go.
